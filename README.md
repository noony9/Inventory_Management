# Inventory_Management
This is a Windows Forms Application (.NET Framework) inventory management application written in C#.  It served as my submitted PA for C968 Software I at WGU.  

To test drive the application, follow the below link to install the zipped files to a directory of your choosing (must be a Windows Operating System compatible with .NET Framework 4.7.2).
